# Cagayan-de-Oro-Catchment
The Cagayan de Oro River catchment, located in Northern Mindanao, Philippines, is highly sensitive to changes in vegetation cover due to its steep slopes and high drainage density (Talampas & Cabahug, 2015). Previous studies have shown that deforestation in the upland areas contributes to rapid runoff, soil erosion, and sedimentation (Mabao & Cabahug, 2014). Although increased discharge variability has been observed, the specific role of deforestation in these changes remains unclear (RBCO, 2007). This leads to the research question of this study:

“What is the impact of deforestation on discharge in the Cagayan de Oro River catchment?”
